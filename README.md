Hello World ðŸ‘‹

:computer: Iâ€™m currently invested in Blockchain [Solidity] and Backend [TS, JS, Python] development

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on more exciting Blockchain projects :ninja:

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to penetrate the Blockchain Dev space as an African. I would love to help :handshake:

âš¡ Fun fact: I have a TV calendar which tracks the 97 shows I watch (or at least try to, lol). Check out my profile dashboard [here](https://pogdesign.co.uk/cat/profile/oooapss). You may find something you like :smile:
